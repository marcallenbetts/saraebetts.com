      <h1>Work Values Inventory</h1>
      <p>
        Psychologist and career theorist Donald J. Super’s work was concerned
        primarily with the development of a person’s self-concept as it relates
        to their career choices. The values you have toward careers and work, he
        said, will impact how you make decisions about which jobs to pursue, as
        well as why you leave jobs. Super also believed that we all go through
        various stages of development throughout our lives in which we
        prioritize different things. Your values are important to consider when
        making educational and career choices, because it is stressful to work
        at a place that is not consistent with what is personally important to
        you. This assignment will help you identify the values that are
        important to you in a job/career and help your Career Navigators when
        they are assisting you with employment opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understand that these values may change and shift over time and
        depending on circumstance, and you may want/need to revisit them on
        occasion to gain a better understanding of what is important to you in
        the job search. Please feel free to reach out to your Career Navigator
        to obtain a new copy of this form when needed.
      </p>
      <h1>Value Descriptions</h1>

        </li>
        <li>
          Way of Life: Work that permits one to live the kind of life he/she

      </ul>

      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>
        Rank each statement using the drop-down menu; a “1” means “unimportant,”
        while a “5” means “very important.” For example, the first statement is,
        “Have to keep solving problems.” If this is something you value highly
        in your work, you would rank it as a “5.” After you rank all of the
        statements, you will see a series of values with your score next to
        each. The higher your score for a value, the more important it is to you
        in your work.
